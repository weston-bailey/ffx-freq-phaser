*Freq Phaser* is an insanely lush stereo phase shifting effect with feedback delay and saturation, a multi-mode quadrature LFO, a mappable and automatable manual phase adjustment, and an analogue-style envelope follower for all of your phase shifting needs. 

*Freq Phaser* is especially well suited for rich classic analogue phase shifter sounds, subtle stereo warbles, adding precise articulations with the manual phase adjustment, and creating dynamic motion with the envelope follower.

*Freq Phaser* is a product of *Freq FX* so OF COURSE you can push the LFO Rate, Feedback, Delay, and Filter Q parameters well beyond typical, 'recommended' settings if you dare to venture into a new frontier of sound-design. A lot of love and time has been spent tuning *Freq Phaser's* parameters so you can create stable, yet chaotic, warbling feedback resonance effects that are unlike anything any other plug-in or stomp-box has to offer.

$Page How Freq Phaser Works 
$TargetName How Freq Phaser Works

Divider.tif

Phase-shifter effects rely on a special type of filter called and *all-pass filter.* You may be familiar with low-pass and high-pass filters, which attenuate the signal’s amplitude at the *frequency cut-off.* In the case of low-pass filters, attenuation occurs above the frequency cutoff,  and below it in the case of high-pass filters. Conversely, *all-pass filters* maintain unity gain at the *frequency cutoff,* and instead they shift the phase of the signal. When this phase shifted signal is recombined with the original signal (called feed-forward) phase-cancellation occurs at the *frequency cut-off*. The warbly sound phase shifter effects produce is caused by modulation of the all-pass filter’s cutoff frequency with an *LFO.*

Divider.tif

Most phase shifter effects rely on *’multi-stage’* all-pass filters, which means several all-pass filters are ran in series(one follows another). EHX Bad Stone phase-shifters (a legendary stompbox) use a 6 stage all-pass filter stack. Small Stones and MXR phase 90s use 4 stages. *Freq Phaser* uses two 4 stage filters stacks in parallel per channel for a total of *16 all-pass filter stages.*    

Divider.tif

*Freq Phaser* also has *two LFOs,* one per channel. The LFOs are phase locked, so they always run at the same speed, but can be offset from each other for unusual stereo effects. The LFO in *Freq Phaser* can be replaced with a *“Manual Phase Adjustment”,* inspired by the Bad Stone pedal, or by an amplitude-driven envelope follower.

*Freq Phaser’s* specific parameters are covered in the next several pages.

$Page Phaser Controls
$TargetName Phaser Controls

Divider.tif

The Six main controls of *Freq Phaser* can be found on the left panel. 

PS1.png

Divider.tif

*Filter Q* [0% -100%] how much phase shifting occurs at the frequency cutoff. More Q = thicker phase shifting.

*FeedForward* [-100% – 100%] Controls how much of the original signal is recombined with the phase-shifted output. Negative values invert the signal.

*Feedback* [-100% – 100%] Controls how much of the all-pass filter stack’s output is feed back into its input. Negative values invert the signal.

*FB Delay* [0% – 100%] Add between 1 sample and .25 seconds of delay in the feedback. To get classic phase shifter effects, keep this at 0%, but set it to 25% for strange comb-filter effects and to higher values for spaced-out slap-back echo effects.

*Depth* [0% – 100%] Controls how much the LFO effects the frequency cutoff. Lower values will emphasize lower frequencies more.

*L/R Offset* [0% – 100%] Controls the offset between the LFOs that control each channel. Thee deepest phase shifter effects come from having both LFOs aligned (either at 0% or 100%), amd more subtle stereo effects can be achieved with an offset between channels.

This is the *LFO Visualizer.*

Both the *Depth* and the *L/R Offset* parameters will display in the *LFO Visualizer.*

You can select from one of *four modes* at the top of the *LFO Controls.*

The middle of the LFO Controls is *mode-dependent,* and will update base on which mode is selected.

The *LFO Visualizer* will always update based on the changes you are making.

The Four *LFO Modes* are discussed on the next page.

$TargetName LFO Modes


Divider.tif

PS7.png

In *Free Mode* the LFO runs independent of Live’s tempo and can be set in hz (cycles per second).

*Waveform* [5 selections] Allows you to choose from 5 different wave forms for the LFO.
1 –  A simple sine wave.
2 –  A Triangle wave.
3 –  A Square wave with duty-cycle shaping slightly rounded edges to prevent filter blow-outs.
4 –  A completely random wave (still moves at set speed)
5 –  Random wave that is the same between channels

*Duty* [0% - 75%] Control the duty of the square wave.

*Rate* [.01hz - 50hz] Set the LFO in cycles per second (hz).

Divider.tif

PS8.png

In *Sync Mode* the LFO runs at a musical time division relative to Live’s transport. Otherwise, it is identical to *Free Mode.* Please note that in *Sync Mode* Live’s transport must be running for the LFO to run. This is because it is *phase locked* to Live’s transport – i.e. it will always be at the same place at the same time in the time-line.

*Sync* [dotted whole note - 128th note] Set the LFO to a musical sub-division.
  
Divider.tif

PS9.png

In *Set Mode* the LFO is manually adjustable. It is MIDI Mappable and Automatable. It can also be mapped with other M4L modulation devices. You may notice that you hear a little lag in the phase shifter from your adjustments. This is due to a slew limiter that is added to make sure that the filter’s *cut off frequencies* are not adjusted too quickly, as this can lead to blow-outs.

*Manual Phase* [0% - 100%] manually adjust or automate the frequency cut off of the all-pass filters.

*Response* [Sine - Ramp] Change the response of the manual phase from a linear ramp to a sine wave.

Divider.tif

PS10.png

In *Env Mode* the LFO is driven by an *envelope follower* that is triggered by the amplitude of the incoming signal. The *envelope follower* has a mushy, analogue feel by design and all the parameters interact with each other.

*Attack* [0% - 100%] How quickly the envelope follower engages.

*Release* [0% - 100%] How quickly the envelope follower disengages.

*Thresh* [-infdB - -0.5dB] Amplitude level that triggers the envelope follower.

*Sense* [0% - 100%] The overall sensitivity of the envelope follower.

*Response* [Sine - Ramp] Drive either a sine wave or linear curve with the envelope.

*Direction* [Up – Down] Choose whether the enverlope starts at 0 and increases (up) or starts at 1. and decreases (down).

*Width* [0%  -200%] Control the stereo width of the wet (effected) signal.

*Balance* [50L – 50R] Place the wet (effected) signal in the stereo field. 

*Amp* [-48dB - +48dB] Control the wet (effected) signal’s amplitude.

*Dry/Wet* [0%  - 100%] Blend between the dry signal(bypassing effect) and wet signal(effected).

$Page Sound Design Tips
$TargetName Sound Design Tips

Sound design tips:
-> To get the classic lush analogue phaser sounds, Keep *Filter Q* high, around 80%+, keep *L/R Offset* on 0%, *FB Delay* on 0%, and adjust the tone of the phaser effect with the *Feedback* and *Feedforward.*
-> Try using *Manual Phase* sweeps the way you would use fiilter cut-off sweeps on your tracks. Better yet, combine the two.
-> Turn down the *Depth* to emphasize lower frequencies
-> Modulate the *FB Delay* with automation or other devices to put a flanger in the feedback loop.
-> Close the *Width* down to 0% for mono phase shifter effects and try setting *L/R Offset* with the *Width* at 0% for even more phasing chaos
-> With the *Filter Q, Feedback, and Depth* at 100% Freq Phaser will self oscillate. You can control the sonic nature of the self oscillation with the *Manual Phase,* and *FB Delay* parameters. 
-> When adjusting the the envelope, keep in mind the parameters interact with each other, so its best to nudge them around (especially the *Thresh* and *Sense).*  
-> Remember, the Envelope follows the AMPLITUDE of the incoming signal, so if you sound doesn’t have a long tail, you may not hear much effect on release.
